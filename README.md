WerewolfX is an adaptation of the popular social deduction game Werewolf!

## Werewolf X rules
In WerewolfX, everyone has a secret codename and the game centers on players sharing, hiding, and lying about these codenames.
At the beginning of the game werewolves only know codenames of their fellow werewolves.

### Phase 1: Forming the pack
The game begins at night. Players begin to socialize and gather information, all the while the werewolves amongst them attempt to find each other and join forces.
The werewolves must find each other to work together to eat someone in the village before the night is over.
To eat someone, werewolves can vote on their page by player name to eat someone. When a majority of werewolves have the same vote, that player will die, ending the first night.

### Phase 2: Election
After the first night, the village may elect a mayor. While a mayor is in office, werewolves can no longer eat player by player name, but must instead vote with player codenames.
Players will be given a period to declare their candidacy, after which all candidates will be publicly announced along with their codenames. Candidates will then be given a campaign period to try and get people to vote for them. Most votes becomes mayor (In the case of 1 candidate, they automatically win). In case of tie, the first to have decided to run will be mayor. 
The mayor is also granted some powers. First, they cannot be eaten by werewolves. In addition each night, they may investigate a player to learn their codename. However, they may remain in office for 2 nights. 
At any point during the following days, someone can challenge the mayor and their code is announced. After a campaign period, a vote is held. The incumbent wins ties.

### Phase 3: Lynching
Just as in normal werewolf, each day the village may lynch a member of the village. Players may also vote to not kill anyone. The player/option with the most votes dies. 
*(\*Note This is done by player name, not codename)*
